        A couple of weeks ago, I saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pydanny"> Daniel Roy Greenfeld </a> make a post
        about Tailwind CSS, and that was the beginning of a beautiful journey. Haven personally disliked how most sites
        built with popular CSS frameworks look alike and generally how difficult it is to completely restyle,
        TailwindCSS was just what I've been searching for. A few weeks later, I'm applying for a Full-Stack Developer role
        with the awesome team behind it.
