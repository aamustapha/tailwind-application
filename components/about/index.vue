        I must admit, I was short on ideas on exactly what to put on this site, I didn't want it to be a full clone of my
        portfolio since there's a link to that already. While I'm trying to ensure it clearly communicates my excitement,
        skills and doesn't bore you with too much information. I figred out the best way to do that was to tell my story
        using cards from the design tile on <a href="https://tailwindui.com/img/hero-pattern-lg.png" class="text-teal-700"> Tailwind UI.</a>
