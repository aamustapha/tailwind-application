      I was short on ideas on exactly what to put on this site, I didn't want it to be a full clone of my personal
      resume since there's a link to that already. While I'm trying to ensure it clearly communicates my excitement,
      skills and doesn't bore you with too much information. I figred out the best way to do that was to tell my story
      using cards from the design tile on <a href="https://tailwindui.com/img/hero-pattern-lg.png"> Tailwind UI </a>
