> Tailwind UI Job Application

As part of the requirements for [Tailwind UI Fullstack Developer Role](https://apply.workable.com/tailwind-ui/j/E129989EC6/),
I put together this page to say a little story about myself.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
